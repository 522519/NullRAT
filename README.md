> # How to use:
#### Requirements:
- **Python 3.8+** (Tick "Add to PATH" while installing) [Microsoft Store version of Python **is broken**]
- **PIP Folder added to path** (the path is `C:\Users\{username}\Appdata\Roaming\Python\{python ver (Example: Python310)}\Scripts`)

#### Preparation:
- Create a Discord Bot and [get it's token](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#discord-bot-token)
- [Create a proper invite link](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#proper-bot-invite-link) and add it to your server
- Optionally, store the [Notification ID](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#channel-id) and [Server ID](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#server-ids) along with the token for easy access

#### Steps:
1. Dowload the latest release of NullRAT (git cloning/download zip will no longer work)
2. Run the Dependencies Installer (which will install NullRAT's dependencies)
3. Run the Variables generator and input the stored information as required
4. Run the Compiler and provide all your options. NullRAT payload will be right there!
