## How to use:
#### Requirements:
- **Python 3.8+** (Tick "Add to PATH" while installing) [Microsoft Store version of Python **is broken**]
- **PIP Folder added to path** (the path is `%APPDATA%\Python\{Your Python Version}\Scripts`)

#### Preparation:
- Create a Discord Bot and [get it's token](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#discord-bot-token)
- [Create an invite link](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md#proper-bot-invite-link) and add it to your server
- Read [Getting Variables.md](https://github.com/NullCode1337/NullRAT/blob/source/Getting%20Variables.md) and store all the variables in a temporary file

#### Steps:
1. Dowload the latest release of NullRAT (git cloning/download zip will no longer work)
2. Run the Dependencies Installer (which will install NullRAT's dependencies)
3. Run the Compiler, and input information according to the temporary file. NullRAT payload will be right there!
